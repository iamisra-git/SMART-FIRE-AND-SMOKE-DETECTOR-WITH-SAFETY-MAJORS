Overview

This project aims to develop a smart security system that efficiently detects smoke and fire while ensuring active and instant safety measures to minimize damage. The system integrates a smart alerting mechanism and a smart responding mechanism to create a comprehensive fire detection and prevention solution.

Features

Smart Smoke and Fire Detection: Uses sensors to detect smoke, temperature, and density.

Automated Safety Measures: Takes active steps such as controlling dampers and closing windows/doors to prevent fire spread.

User-Friendly Control: Provides an interface for users to monitor and control the system.

Minimized False Alarms: Implements an intelligent algorithm to differentiate between different levels of threats.

Integration with IoT Devices: Can work with smart home systems for enhanced security.

Future Enhancements

Implement a carbon monoxide (CO) detection system.

Enhance AI-driven decision-making for more accurate threat detection.

Develop a mobile application for remote monitoring and control.
